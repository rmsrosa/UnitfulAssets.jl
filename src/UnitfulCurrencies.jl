    UnitfulCurrencies

Module extending Unitful.jl with currencies.

A currency dimension 𝐂 is created and most, if not all, active currencies
around the world are defined as units with dimension 𝐂. The Euro is set
as the reference unit for 𝐂.

An ExchangeMarket type is also defined as a Dict{String,Real} for containing
currency pairs (see `ExchangeMarket`).

Based on an given exchange market, a conversion can be made from a "quote"
currency to the "base" currency. This is implemented as an extended
dispatch for `uconvert`.

    ExchangeMarket

Alias for the type used for exchange rates pairs, given as a
Dict{String,Float64}, where the key is expected to be a 
six-characters string containing the concatenation of the
alphabetic codes ISO-4217 of the base and quote currencies,
and the value is the exchange rate between these currencies.

For instance, the Dict

    exr_mkt = Dict("EURUSD" => 1.164151)

is of ExchangeMarket type and it means that, in this exchange maket,
one can trade 1 EUR for 1.164151 USD, i.e. one can buy 1 EUR
with 1.164151 USD.
